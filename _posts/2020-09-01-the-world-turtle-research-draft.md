excerpt from Wikipedia:
```
The World Turtle carries the Earth upon its back in myths from North America; for this reason many aboriginal North Americans refer to it as Turtle Island.

To some Native American tribes, the turtle is a symbol of the mother of the Earth. Most turtles have 13 scales, or scutes, on the backs of their shells. For Native Americans, these scutes represented the 13 full moons in each year. In addition, on the very outer rim of most turtlesâ€™ shells, there are 28 smaller scutes. In Native American culture, these 28 sections represented the 28 days of the lunar month. Thus, turtles were considered to have celestial powers, playing a role in the creation of the world.[35]

In Cheyenne tradition, the great creator spirit Maheo kneads some mud he takes from a coot's beak until it expands so much that only Old Grandmother Turtle can support it on her back. In Mohawk tradition, the trembling or shaking of the Earth is thought of as a sign that the World Turtle is stretching beneath the great weight that she carries.[5]

Native Americans used combs made of tortoise shell to signify the margin between life and death. According to their beliefs, the cosmic tree emerges from the spine of the tortoise.[7]

The expression "turtles all the way down" comes from the notion of the World Turtle.
